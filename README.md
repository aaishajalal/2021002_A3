# Collaborative Filtering Assignment

This repository contains the assignment implementation for Collaborative Filtering using Deep Neural Networks.

## Contents

- `assignment_notebook.ipynb`: Google Colab notebook implementing MLP and Autoencoder models.
- Description of dataset, preprocessing, training, and evaluation.

## How to run

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Upload the dataset files (`movies.csv`, `ratings.csv`, etc.) in the same folder.
3. Run all cells to train and evaluate the models.

## Results

- Both models trained for 10 epochs.
- Evaluation using RMSE metric.

- P.S I added 2 files .ipynb and .py of the same notebook because sometimes one of them does not work in github.
